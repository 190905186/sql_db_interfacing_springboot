-   interpolation cannot contain assignments
-   interpolations cannot be used to access the global variables
-   through interpolation we can :
    -   use the variables of the lass in the html
    -   use the methods of the class in the html
-   property binding is a technique through which we can assign the attribute of the html tags the desired value defined in the class.
-   when we use angular the pages will not be reloded if we try to click any other link present in the page that stays on the same tab
-   angular does not re-render every element again if there is a change to the single element in the page. only the elements which needs to be changed will be changed without affecting other elements.
